                <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago </p>

Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

It’s unforgettable. Don’t forget to be here at HWC on 5/25/21 to get this classic edition! This car is not only beautiful, but it was fast, too. Aimed directly at the American market, it didn’t miss its target. Movie stars, business moguls, sports figures … the mass appeal of this car made it a status symbol and a pop culture icon. It’s appeared in numerous films, too. Interesting side note: The 300 SL heavily influenced the design of the DeLorean DMC-12, from the gull-wing doors to the intent to capture public attention. We released a DeLorean DMC-12 here on HWC in 2012 – with the polished chrome finish – so this makes a great companion piece in your collection. Providing, of course, you’re lucky enough to have both pieces.

                    While a real 300 SL would be very pricey to obtain, you’ll find ours for just the right price. Step up and step out with this touch of class!</p>

                Euro 2021: Heavyweights collide as France, Germany, Portugal clash

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-ex-12">PARIS: Some of the jeopardy may be removed by the fact that the four best third-placed teams will qualify for the quarter-finals, but Euro 2020's Group F remains full of intrigue as reigning champions Portugal, World Cup holders France and Germany all face off, while Hungary could have their say too.
                    AFP Sport casts its eye over the four teams trying to reach the knockout stage.
                    Portugal are reigning European champions and have reached at least the semi-finals in four of the last five Euros. They came second behind Ukraine in qualifying and, at 36, Cristiano Ronaldo is not getting any younger. However, Portugal also won the Nations League in 2019 and Ronaldo has arguably never been surrounded by so much talent: from Ruben Dias at the back to Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva, Diogo Jota and Joao Felix. If they click, they could take some stopping.
                    Given the talent in Portugal's ranks, perhaps it is unimaginative to single out Ronaldo, but it will be fascinating to follow his progress. At 36 this is probably his penultimate major tournament. Portugal's captain and most-capped player has 103 international goals, with 11 coming in the qualifying campaign. He is now just six shy of the all-time international scoring record of 109 held by Iran's Ali Daei.!</p>
